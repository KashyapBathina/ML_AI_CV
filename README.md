An amalgamation of past work, this repository contains implementations and demo scripts for a variety of classic computer-vision and machine-learning algorithms. Includes ML methods/models like neural networks and transformers, computer vision programs like face detectors (static) and trackers (live camera input), and computer vision problems like edge detection and optical flow, and more.
